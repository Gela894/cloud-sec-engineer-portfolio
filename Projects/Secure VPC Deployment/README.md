# 🔐 Secure VPC Deployment — Operation SkyShield
 
----


> ### Terraform | AWS | Security-First Networking | GovCon-Aligned 

## 🔍 Project Overview

This project demonstrates the deployment of a secure, multi-AZ AWS VPC foundation using Terraform.
It focuses on network segmentation, controlled egress, least-privilege traffic flow, and centralized logging, mirroring real-world requirements commonly seen in GovCon and aerospace environments.

## 🧠 What This Project Demonstrates

* Secure VPC architecture with tiered subnet design

* Controlled outbound access using NAT and VPC endpoints

* Least-privilege traffic enforcement via security groups

* Centralized network and API logging

* Terraform best practices (modules, version pinning, environments)

* Evidence-based validation of security controls

## 🏗 Architecture Overview

* Public subnets (ingress & NAT)

* Private application subnets

* Private data subnets

* Internet Gateway

* NAT Gateway

* Tiered Security Groups

* VPC Flow Logs → CloudWatch

* CloudTrail logging
