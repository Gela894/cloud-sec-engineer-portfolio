# Cloud Security Engineering Portfolio
I am a Cloud Security practitioner with hands-on experience designing secure AWS environments, validating controls, and documenting security decisions. Focused on secure architecture, identity, logging, detection, and validation in AWS.

## What This Portfolio Demonstrates
* Secure cloud architecture design

* Network segmentation and boundary protection

* Identity-first access controls (IAM, SSM)

* Centralized logging and auditability

* Detection and validation of security events

* Infrastructure as Code (Terraform)

## Core Projects
### 🔐 Project 1 — Secure VPC Deployment (Operation SkyShield)

Focus: Network security, identity guardrails, logging, detection

* Objective: Secure AWS network baseline for internal systems

* Key Skills: VPC design, IAM, Flow Logs, CloudTrail, detection

* Proof: Architecture, test results, evidence

* 🔗 Repo: /secure-vpc-deployment

* 🔗 Case File (Notion): (link)

### 🔐 Project 2 — [Project Name]

Focus: (e.g., IAM, identity governance, access control)

* Objective: One-line problem statement

* Key Skills: IAM, policies, roles, analysis

* Proof: Tests, validation, screenshots

* 🔗 Repo: /project-folder-name

* 🔗 Case File: (link if applicable)


## Skills & Tools 

### Cloud & Infrastructure

* AWS (VPC, EC2, IAM, CloudTrail, CloudWatch)

* Terraform

### Security Domains

* Network security & segmentation

* Identity & access management

* Logging, monitoring, detection

* Least privilege & defense in depth

### Practices

* Infrastructure as Code

* Security validation & testing

* Evidence-based documentation

## Documentation Style
Projects are documented using a dual-layer approach:

* Check out Notion for deep-dive of case files with decisions, evidence, and validation
